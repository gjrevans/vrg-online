# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'

      section_1:
        title: "What Is Search Engine Optimization?"
        body: "In simple terms, it's the process of maximizing a website's visibility on the internet by optimizing a site's code for \"crawlability\", by creating targeted on-site content and by obtaining backlinks from other authorative websites related to your product, service or industry.<br /><br /><strong class=\"text-primary\">Crawl-a-bility:</strong> describes a search engine's ability to access and read (i.e. crawl) the content on a website. If a site has no crawlability issues, then a search engine's web crawlers can access all of the site's content easily by following the links between pages.<br /><br />In addition to Crawlability, you site should also include <code>\"keyword relevant content\"</code> like landing pages, business descriptions and / or addresses, contact information, relevant blog articles, videos, and more. We must do all of this work so search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo can learn about the purpose of the site and better represent it in their search results.<br /></br />To win at search one must inevitably think like a search engine. But first, we must think like a customer..."
      section_2:
        title: "Thinking Like A Customer..."
        body: "Imagine, you're the owner of Bob's Towing Company. With hopes of acquiring new customers online, you recently paid a small fortune to have a local software firm to develop you a shiny new website. How exciting!<br /><br />Suddenly and without your knowledge, a potential customer appears just up the street from your business location. They've hit a nail and are in need of a tow. While it's a real bummer for them, it could mean new business for you.<br /><br />This potential customer is new to the area so they do what any normal twenty first century citizen would and they pull out their trusty cell phone and begin a Google search. Thank goodness you had that website built! <br /><br />But wait... for what do they search?<br /><br />Well unfortunately Bob, the potential customer doesn't already know your business name, so they're not going to search for <code>\"Bob's Towing Company\"</code>. Instead they’ll likely search for something like <code>\"towing company near me\"</code> or <code>\"flat tire repair\"</code> and Google will do it’s best to show them matching businesses in the area."
      section_3:
        title: "Being Discoverable & Keyword Ready"
        body: "Welp, bad news bob… your biggest competitor <strong>Joey’s Towing Company</strong>, who is located across town, is the first result on Google and they have 10 five star reviews! In fact, your brand new website doesn't even show up on any of any search result pages.<br /><br />Your potential customer clicks on Joey’s website, dials their phone number and within a few seconds you’ve lost a near perfect lead.<br /><br />So... what went wrong?<br /><br />Well, despite your best intentions, your website wasn't optimized so that search engines like Google could find it. It’s missing special tags in the code and targeted content that lets these search engines know what your business is all about, where you’re located and most importantly the services you offer.<br /><br />There is hope though Bob... With a little bit of elbow grease and potentially a bit of help, you CAN obtain that coveted first page spot and beat Joey to the punch next time."
      section_4:
        title: "How Can My Business Become The #1 Search Result?"
        body: "As we've learned through our example, search engines actually have a pretty tough job. They have to crawl through the entire internet on a regular basis to figure out the purpose of every single website that exists. Sounds exhausting... If only there was an easy way to tell these search engines exactly what your business does, where its located and what services you have to offer so that they didn't have to guess.<br /><br />Well, there actually is. In fact, these search engines have a set of universal guidelines they ask every web developer to follow to ensure the search engine can easily learn about the purpose of the website and properly prioritize it in the search results.<br /></br />Unfortunately, not all websites are created equal... and in the end, it's the business owner who really loses out when a website is poorly put together.<br /><br />These days, it's not just about having a website, but ensuring your website is optimized for discovery. It's your website's job to contain the right content that signals to a search engine that you are the correct match for as many relevant keywords as possible.

        title: "What is Online Advertising?"
        body: "<a href=\"/services/digital-discovery-and-seo\">Search Engine Optimization</a> (SEO) and Online Advertising are two sides of the same coin that make up a well formulated digital marketing strategy. SEO is predominently the process of both website optimization and strategic content creation that signals to Google and other search engines that your website is the best source of information for a given user's search or topic of interest. The better and / or more relevant your content, the higher these search engines will rank your page and thus the more organically visible your business will be.<br /><br />SEO is unfortunately a long term process, but one that pays dividends when the hard work begins to payoff. Once your page has organically reached the first page of a search engine it'll be tough for competors to push your back down the ranks.<br /><br />Paid search on the other hand gives you the ability to instantly ensure that your business shows up when and where your target customers are looking. These digital paid advertisements come in many forms, but the most popular are <strong>Push Based Ads:</strong> Search Ads (Google, Bing, Yahoo) and Video Ads (Youtube), and <strong>Pull Based Ads:</strong> Social Media (Facebook, Instagram, etc.) and display advertising.<br /><br />With push based ads, you are trying to bring your products to your customers. Just as the name suggests, you are trying to \"push\" a particular product or serivce in front an audience that fits your target demographic.<br /><br />With pull based ads, things look a little different. Your customers already know what they are looking for and are seeking the product or service you are offering. In this case, the user engages much more with the product or serivce before they purchase as they go through the process of searching for information actively. Eventually the goal of your pull based ad is to drive the customer from a keyword search to your landing page, business listing, etc."
      section_2:
        title: "Push Based Ads"
        body: "The primary channels of Push Based Ads are social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram as well as other forms of display based advertising. Push based ads quite literally push your content, product or service in front of an audience of your choosing. It's very likely that you've like scrolled past one of these ads in your news feed before and you may even have clicked on one.<br /><br /><img src=\"https://imgur.com/elFIcI1.jpg\" class=\"w-75 rounded img-fluid mx-auto border border-primary\"><br /><br />With this form of advertisement marketers create channel specific content (e.g. a facebook post) and then define the target audience for the advertisement. Setting a target audience ensures the ad will only be displayed to users who are likely to click on the advertisement and convert. These targeting tools allow marketers to specify information like target age, location, interests, geo-fences and much more. Moreover, these channels allow you to create multiple versions of a given advertisement to ensure you can split test (A/B test) your marketing approach and in time select a winning advertisement and produces the best conversions.<br /><br />Traditionally the payment structure of these ads are impression based. That meaning, you will pay for the number of eyes that see your advertisement. With that said, there are advanced strategies that exist where you can pay only for conversions and / or clicks on your advertisements.<br /><br />Facebook and Instagram ads simply appear in a given user's news feed where as other types of display advertisements can appear as banner ads across a network of websites."
      section_3:
        title: "Pull Based Ads"
        body: "The primary channels of Pull Based Ads are Search Engines and Video Marketing with Google and Youtube being the standout channels in these spaces. Pull based ads are created to pull customers into your business by appear where your customers already searching for your product or service.<br /><br /> Imagine your business sells coffee makers. A well formed pull based ad would appear in circumstances where customers are searching for keywords that indicate their interests in purchasing a coffee maker (e.g when a customer searches for <code>\"Black & Decker Coffee Maker\"</code> on Google).<br /><br /><img src=\"https://imgur.com/9H8Yk4c.jpg\" class=\"w-75 rounded img-fluid mx-auto border border-primary\"><br /><br />The first type of pull based ads are search ads and they are, more or less, exactly what they sounds like. When a user searches for a given phrase or keyword within a search engine, a business can <strong>bid</strong> to have their advertisement shown first in the search results. In this form of advertising, you pay for the number of clicks on your advertisment as opposed to impressions.<br /><br />When bidding on these search terms and keywords, you will be up against everyother businesses that is also keen to have their ad placed at the top of Google's search results. As such the bidding process can at times become quite complicated and challenging to navigate. Working with an experienced digital marketing partner to formulate a well planned keyword bidding strategy can help your online advertising budget reach significantly more potential customers and eliminate waste.<br /><br />The other primary channel of pull based marketing are video advertisements. These are the video ads that show up before and during a video you're watching channels like Youtube. Similar to search ads, these platforms analyse both the search terms that a given user has entered on the platform, the type of videos the user is consuming as well as other online behaviours to determine where and when to display a targeted video advertisement."

        body: "As software developers, the number one question we get asked, inside and outside work, is <strong>\"how much do you think it would it cost to build XYZ\"</strong>. Where XYZ is some sort of feature, website, mobile app, etc. And although I wish there was a universal pricing chart for all things technology, the reality is that without more information there is no one specific answer. Pricing for projects like website development are typically straightforward and we've even created a pricing chart below to act as a jumping off point. With that said, many software development projects include a number of custom features and functionalities that require technical scoping and investigation and in turn simply equate to a set of billable hours or featues.<br /><br/>For all of these reason, VRG Interactive offers <strong class=\"text-primary\">free technical consultations</strong> where we can discuss your project and help you better understand the scope of work that may be involved in reaching your specific goal.  We'll even bring the coffee. After our consultation, assuming you want to move forward, we will provide you with a scope of work document as well as a project timeline. All included features and costs will be made completely clear and we will only begin development once we have recieved your specific sign off.<br /><br />With all that said, there are two cardinal rules that apply universally to all technology development. Those being, you <strong>always</strong> get what you pay for and nothing good is ever free. If someone tries to convince you otherwise, run the other way.<br /><br />If you have a technology idea, are interested in developing a website or web application or just want to discuss your technology needs, then we're here to help.
