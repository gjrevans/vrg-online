# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'

      section_1:
        title: "What Is Search Engine Optimization?"
        body: "In simple terms, it's the process of maximizing a website's visibility on the internet by optimizing a site's code for \"crawlability\" and by creating targeted on-site content.<br /><br /><strong class=\"text-primary\">Crawl-a-bility:</strong> describes a search engine's ability to access and read (i.e. crawl) the content on a website. If a site has no crawlability issues, then a search engine's web crawlers can access all of the site's content easily by following the links between pages.<br /><br />In addition to Crawlability, you site should also include \"keyword relevant content\" like landing pages, business descriptions and addresses, contact information, relevant blog articles, videos, and more. We must do all of this work so search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo can learn about the purpose of the site and better represent it in their search results.<br /></br />To win at search one must inevitably think like a search engine. But first, we must think like a customer..."
      section_2:
        title: "Thinking Like A Customer..."
        body: "Imagine, you're the owner of Bob's Towing Company. With hopes of acquiring new customers online, you recently paid a small fortune to have a local software firm to develop you a shiny new website. How exciting!<br /><br />Suddenly and without your knowledge, a customer appears just up the street from your business location. They've hit a nail and are in need of a tow. While it sucks for them, it could mean new business for you.<br /><br />This potential customer is new to the area so they do what any normal 21st century citizen would and they pull out their trusty cell phone and begin a Google search. Thank goodness you had that website build, right!? <br /><br />But, for what do they search?<br /><br />Well, unfortunately for you Bob, it's not going to be \"Bob's Towing Company\". Instead they’ll likely search for something like \"towing company near me\" and Google will do it’s best to show them matching businesses in the area."
      section_3:
        title: "Being Keyword Ready"
        body: "Well, Bad news for you Bob… your biggest competitor \"Joey’s Towing Company\" is the first result on Google and they have 10 five star reviews! In fact, your brand new website doesn't even show up in any of any search result page.<br /><br />Your potential customer clicks on Joey’s website, dials their phone number and within a few seconds you’ve lost a near perfect lead.<br /><br />What went wrong? Well, despite your best intentions, your website hasn’t been optimized so that search engines like Google can find it, read through your content and learn about your services.<br /><br />It’s missing special tags in the code and targeted content that lets search engines like Google know what your business is all about, where you’re located and most importantly that you are in fact a \"towing company\" near that potential client.<br /><br />There is hope though Bob... With a little bit of elbow grease, you can obtain that coveted first page spot and beat Joey to the punch next time."
      section_4:
        title: "How Can I Become The #1 Search Result?"
        body: "As we've learned through our example, search engines use a number of signaling factors that determine which pages show up first and which ones get burried. These signals are predominantly based on how well a website's content matches a customers search term and search engines call these search terms \"keywords\". These days, it's not just about having a website, but ensuring your website is optimized for discovery. It's your website's job to contain the right content that signals to a search engine that you are the correct match for as many relevant keywords as possible.<br /><br /> Google determines the keywords your site matches by reading through the content on your website to pick out phrases, locations and other important criteria that it can match to a customer search term.<br /><br />The reality is that anyone can, with the time, know-how and tools, improve the rank of a website. However, there is a right way and a wrong way to do it and the ramifications of doing it incorrectly can blacklist your website for years to come."
