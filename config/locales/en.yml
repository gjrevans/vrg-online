# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'

      section_1:
        title: "What Is Search Engine Optimization?"
        body: "In simple terms, it's the process of maximizing a website's visibility on the internet by optimizing a site's code for \"crawlability\" and by creating targeted on-site content.<br /><br /><strong class=\"text-primary\">Crawl-a-bility:</strong> describes a search engine's ability to access and read (i.e. crawl) the content on a website. If a site has no crawlability issues, then a search engine's web crawlers can access all of the site's content easily by following the links between pages.<br /><br />In addition to Crawlability, you site should also include <code>\"keyword relevant content\"</code> like landing pages, business descriptions and addresses, contact information, relevant blog articles, videos, and more. We must do all of this work so search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo can learn about the purpose of the site and better represent it in their search results.<br /></br />To win at search one must inevitably think like a search engine. But first, we must think like a customer..."
      section_2:
        title: "Thinking Like A Customer..."
        body: "Imagine, you're the owner of Bob's Towing Company. With hopes of acquiring new customers online, you recently paid a small fortune to have a local software firm to develop you a shiny new website. How exciting!<br /><br />Suddenly and without your knowledge, a potential customer appears just up the street from your business location. They've hit a nail and are in need of a tow. While it's a real bummer for them, it could mean new business for you.<br /><br />This potential customer is new to the area so they do what any normal 21st century citizen would and they pull out their trusty cell phone and begin a Google search. Thank goodness you had that website built! <br /><br />But wait... for what do they search?<br /><br />Well unfortunately Bob, the potential customer doesn't already know you're name, so likely they're not going to search for <code>\"Bob's Towing Company\"</code>. Instead they’ll likely search for something like <code>\"towing company near me\"</code> and Google will do it’s best to show them matching businesses in the area."
      section_3:
        title: "Being Discoverable & Keyword Ready"
        body: "Bad news… your biggest competitor \"Joey’s Towing Company\", who is located across town, is the first result on Google and they have 10 five star reviews! In fact, your brand new website doesn't even show up on any of any search result pages.<br /><br />Your potential customer clicks on Joey’s website, dials their phone number and within a few seconds you’ve lost a near perfect lead.<br /><br />So then, what went wrong? Well, despite your best intentions, your website wasn't optimized so that search engines like Google could find it. It’s missing special tags in the code and targeted content that lets these search engines know what your business is all about, where you’re located and most importantly the services you offer.<br /><br />There is hope though Bob... With a little bit of elbow grease and potentially a bit of help, you CAN obtain that coveted first page spot and beat Joey to the punch next time."
      section_4:
        title: "How Can My Business Become The #1 Search Result?"
        body: "As we've learned through our example, search engines actually have a pretty tough job. They have to crawl through the entire internet on a regular basis to figure out the purpose of each website that exists. Sounds exhausting... If only there was an easy way to tell these search engines exactly what your business does, where its located and what services you have to offer so that they didn't have to guess.<br /><br />Well, there actually is. In fact, these search engines have a set of universal guidelines they ask every web developer to follow to ensure the search engine can easily learn about the purpose of the website and properly prioritize it in the search results.<br /></br />Unforutnaly, not all websites are created equal... and in the end, it's the business owner who really loses out.<br /><br />These days, it's not just about having a website, but ensuring your website is optimized for discovery. It's your website's job to contain the right content that signals to a search engine that you are the correct match for as many relevant keywords as possible. Below we've compiled our SEO must-dos for 2020 that you can actually implement yourself.<br /><br />Or, if you're busy, you know... <strong class=\"text-primary\">running your business</strong> and maybe need a bit of help ranking on the first page of every top search engine, then we'd love to talk to you."

        title: "Who Needs A Website in 2020?"
        body: "The reality is, any business competing for customer awareness in the 21st century can benefit from having an online presence. These days your potential customers are turning to Google for answers before looking anywhere else. Traditional marketing channels like TV, radio, displays ads, and mail are unfortunately a thing of the past. So, if your business isn't part of a <code>customer's search results</code>, then more often than not you're simply not going to be a part of the conversation.<br /><br />In addition to lead generation, your website also has the ability to become your best marketing channel. For example, simply give your website visitors a reason to join your mailing list (e.g. 10% off their next purchase) and instantly you're generating a list of potential customers through whom you can advertise for <strong class=\"text-primary\">FREE</strong> at any given time.<br /><br />Perhaps you're a business who sells products? Why not join the e-commerce revolution by selling your products online and in turn instantly increase your potential customer base by, well.. the entire world. Or, if you're a service based business, why not advertise what you do online... for free.<br /><br />Now, I'm not going to blow sprinkles up your butt and tell you that website is <strong>instantly</strong> going to revolutionize your business. In 2020 its going to take more than that. Your website not only needs to stand out, its going to need to be discoverable. You're going to need to do all of the right things that let search engines like Google know you exist, where you're located, what you do and more so that potential customers can actually find you.<br /><br />As you can imagine, this process does reqires a bit of know-how and will involve a combination of online marketing tactics like search engine optimization, paid advertising, social media development, business listings, and more.<br /><br />Fortunately for you, <strong>online discoverability</strong> just so happens to be our middle name. Okay... okay... it's not our middle name, but we are really, really, really good at it. You're here reading this after all, aren't you...?<br /><br />So, if you'd like to know more about getting your business online or simply need a hand improving your existing website's online discoverability, then lets chat.<br /><br />P.S.

        title: "Software Development Pricing"
        body: "As software developers, the number one question we get asked, inside and outside work, is <strong>\"how much do you think it would it cost to build XYZ\"</strong>. Where XYZ is some sort of feature, website, mobile app, etc. And although I wish there was a universal pricing chart for all things technology, the reality is that without more information there is no one specific answer. Pricing for projects like website development are typically straightforward and we've even created a pricing chart below to act as a jumping off point. With that said, many software development projects include a number of custom features and functionalities that require technical scoping and investigation and in turn simply equate to a set of billable hours or featues.<br /><br/>For all of these reason, VRG Interactive offers <strong class=\"text-primary\">free technical consultations</strong> where we can discuss your project and help you better understand the scope of work that may be involved in reaching your specific goal.  We'll even bring the coffee. After our consultation, assuming you want to move forward, we will provide you with a scope of work document as well as a project timeline. All included features and costs will be made completely clear and we will only begin development once we have recieved your specific sign off.<br /><br />With all that said, there are two cardinal rules that apply universally to all technology development. Those being, you <strong>always</strong> get what you pay for and nothing good is ever free. If someone tries to convince you otherwise, run the other way.<br /><br />If you have a technology idea, are interested in developing a website or web application or just want to discuss your technology needs, then we're here to help. Use our handy contact form below to give us a bit more information and we will be in touch shortly."
